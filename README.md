# Advent of Code 2024

Just trying to survive until the 25th this time around.

## Development

I copy `tpl.py` to `day-xx.py` before I start.

While working on the solution, I use `./develop.sh day-xx.py` to verify that
I read the input in correctly, and I debug with `print`.

I put the sample input and true input in these files:

- `sample.in`
- `data.in`

Sometimes I make other test sets, in which case I do `./develop.sh day-xx.py other-file.in`
instead.
